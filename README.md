# Library Management using (MERN)
## Overview
The Library Management System (LMS) is a web application designed to streamline the management of library books, user accounts, book borrowing and returns, and user reviews. 
It features an admin interface for managing books, users, and reviews, while providing a user-friendly experience for library members to borrow, return, and review books.
This project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and TailwindCSS for styling 
. The system includes role-based access control (RBAC) with different user roles (e.g., admin, user).
